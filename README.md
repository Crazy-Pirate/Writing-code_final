# 🧠 Counterfactual Diagnosis Engine

This project is based on the [Nature Communications 2020 paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17419-7) by Richens et al., titled **"Improving the accuracy of medical diagnosis with causal machine learning."**

It implements a causal reasoning engine that:
- Learns medical causal structures from data.
- Performs diagnosis by simulating counterfactual interventions on symptom networks.
- Supports both symptom severity and risk factor prominence (custom extensions).

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/counterfactual-diagnosis.git
   cd counterfactual-diagnosis
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run diagnosis:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🧪 Features

* Learns a Bayesian network from disease-symptom-risk relationships.
* Simulates interventions (`do()` calculus) to compute counterfactual probabilities.
* Accounts for:

  * **Symptom severity** (e.g., mild, moderate, severe)
  * **Risk factor influence** (e.g., smoking, family history)

### ✅ Next Step

Save each of these files into your project directory, then run:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add README, requirements, and .gitignore"
git push
```

Let me know if you want me to generate a `LICENSE` file, documentation for each module, or a sample run log.
